# Analysis-of-Hackers-News-Posts
Analysis of a dataset of submissions of posts to a popular technology site known as Hacker News. Our aim is to determine which type of post receives more comment on average between "Ask HN" and "Show HN". Also, we intend to determine if posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average.
